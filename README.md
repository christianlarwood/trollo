# Trollo App

##Background
Trollo is a Trello-like application built with React/Redux, Node.js/Express, and connected to MongoDB.

## Running the app
While in the server directory, run `npm run dev` to start the live server. The live server will watch for changes to files in the `src` directory and reload the page when they're changed.

## Viewing Static Version of the App
While developing the app, you can take a look at the static pages that you'll eventually convert into a dynamic application. To do so, visit `http://localhost:3000/ui` in the browser.
